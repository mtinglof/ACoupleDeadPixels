# A Couple Dead Pixels 
> A 2D Puzzle/ Shooter Developed in Unity

A Couple Dead Pixels is a 2D puzzle/ shooter game I developed in Unity for a Game Design class I'm taking at San Diego State. The game is centered around George, a stranded space man who has to restart his ship while avoiding being eaten by aliens. 

## Installing / Getting started

The respository includes all game assets and scripts. In order to play the game, one must have a copy of unity downloaded. From there, the respository can be downloaded and loaded into Unity, then built for play. 

## Features

The game features 

* A ship that randomly generates each time you play
* Some really cool pixel art I made 
* Some really cool pixel art others made (see below for their links) 

## Contributing

As always, branch and pull requests are glady accepted. I'm hoping to add allies in the future.
